Send a short description of the condition of the gear torque arms along with the vdf-buffer and ram-dump to your technical support department further analysis. If the dominating oscillation frequency in the generator speed (above 0.5 Hz) is the 3P frequency (f3p=3*rotor rpm/60 [Hz]) the error is caused by extreme wind conditions and not defect gear torque arms or wrong parameters. If the dominating oscillation is between 2 and 3 Hz the gear torque arms probably are defect."
